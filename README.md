Logistic Regression

# Problem Statement: -

1.	A psychological study has been conducted by a team of students at a university on married couples to determine the cause of having an extra marital affair. They have surveyed and collected a sample of data on which they would like to do further analysis. Apply Logistic Regression on the data to correctly classify whether a given person will have an affair or not given the set of attributes. Convert the naffairs column to discrete binary type before proceeding with the algorithm.


2.	In this time and age of widespread internet usage, effective and targeted marketing plays a vital role. A marketing company would like to develop a strategy by analyzing their customer data. For this, data like age, location, time of activity, etc. has been collected to determine whether a user will click on an ad or not. Perform Logistic Regression on the given data to predict whether a user will click on an ad or not


3. Perform Logistic Regression on the dataset to predict whether a candidate will win or lose the election based on factors like amount of money spent and popularity rank


4.	It is vital for banks that customers put in long term fixed deposits as they use it to pay interest to customers and it is not viable to ask every customer if they will put in a long-term deposit or not. So, build a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a customer will put in a long-term fixed deposit or not based on the different variables given in the data. The output variable in the dataset is Y which is binary. Snapshot of the dataset is given below.
